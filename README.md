# Cloud Computing - Google Cloud Vision API

## Context

You are employed by a Swiss small/medium business making heavy use of information technology. Your boss is intrigued by cloud computing. He has read that it allows companies like yours to benefit from IT infrastructure that until recently only the big players, like Nestlé, Novartis, UBS or Crédit Suisse could afford.

Your boss asks that you investigate, in a small group of colleagues, a cloud service or cloud-related technology that could be of interest to your company. He wants you to prepare a presentation, for him and the product development team, that explains the service / technology. He also wants you to develop an application showing the benefits in a small proof-of-concept. You are asked to demo the proof-of-concept in the second part of your presentation.
